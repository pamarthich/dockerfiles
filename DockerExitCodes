The following are the container Exit codes you see when a container is stopped

Note: Typically every code other than 0 is considered an error

Exit code 0     -->  0 means the programm stopped correctly without any errors
Exit code 1     --> as of now from the gathered info it might be due to some error with code in Dockerfile
Exit code 2     -->
Exit code 143   --> Occurs when a stop signal passed to the container (Graceful Shutdown)
Exit code 137   --> Occurs when a kill signal passed to the container (kills the Container)


Continuously running executable things we need to run at the end of the dockerfile
